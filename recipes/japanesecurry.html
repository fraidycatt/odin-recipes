        <h4>A weeknight dinner straight from Japan, utilizing curry roux blocks for simplicity and speed.</h4>
           <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 onions, sliced</li>
                <li>2 carrots, peeled and sliced</li>
                <li>4 large potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
                <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
                <li>A full packet of Vermont Curry</li>
                <li>5 cups of chicken broth</li>
                <li>1 tbsp sake</li>
                <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>Air Fryer Pork Katsu recipe-- separate</li>
                <li>Cooked Rice for serving</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>STEPS</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat a large pot over medium high heat and add your oil.</li>
                <li>When oil begins to shimmer, add onion and saute until you feel the vibes are right-- five to ten minutes.</li>
                <li>Add potatoes and carrots and cook, stirring occasionally, for about five more minutes.</li>
                <li>Add chicken broth and turn heat up to a boil. Reduce heat to a steady simmer and cover, letting it simmer until the vegetables are all cooked.</li>
                <li>Break apart the curry roux into blocks and drop into the broth and vegetable mixture. Stir until it's dissolved. </li>
                <li>Add soy sauce and sake and cook, stirring constantly to ensure the curry doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan, for two minutes.</li>
                <li>Place a serving of rice on one side of the plate; spoon the curry on the other side of the plate so that they meet in the center. Place freshly sliced, hot katsu across the top of both, and serve.</li>
            </ol>
